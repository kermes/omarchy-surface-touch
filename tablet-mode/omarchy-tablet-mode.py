"""Publish Surface tablet-mode state, and run hooks when it changes.

Two distinct conditions, and device presence alone only sees one of them:

  * the Type Cover is detached, and
  * the Type Cover is folded back behind the screen -- still attached, still
    enumerated, so a presence check misses the most common tablet posture.

Fold-back is reported as SW_TABLET_MODE on an EV_SW device. Where that device
lives differs by model, which is why nothing here matches on a device name:

  * Surface Go: chassis-level ("Intel HID switches"). It persists when the
    cover is detached, so the two conditions stay independent.
  * Surface Pro 7+: provided by the Type Cover itself ("Microsoft Surface Type
    Cover Tablet Mode Switch", a name shared by ten kernel devices there, only
    one of which exposes SW_TABLET_MODE). Detaching removes the switch, so the
    two conditions collapse into one.

A missing switch therefore means "no cover", not "not in tablet mode" -- which
the predicate below already handles, since it asks whether a usable keyboard is
present rather than trusting the switch alone.

This publishes hardware state rather than acting on it: /run/omarchy-tablet-mode
holds the current values and every executable in /etc/omarchy-tablet-mode.d/ is
run on each transition with them in the environment. An on-screen keyboard is
the first consumer, shipped as a hook; rotation lock and the lock screen
plausibly want the same signal.

Runs as root from a system unit so it can read /dev/input directly.
