# Tablet mode

Publishes whether the physical keyboard is usable, and runs hooks when that
changes. An on-screen keyboard is shipped as the first hook; it is hardware
state rather than keyboard behaviour, so rotation lock, the lock screen or
anything else can consume the same signal.

Not installed by `--all`: it changes behaviour for anyone who relies on the
keyboard being available to toggle at any time.

```bash
./install.sh tablet-mode
```

## Two conditions, and why presence alone is not enough

The keyboard is unusable when either:

- the Type Cover is **detached**, or
- the Type Cover is **folded back** behind the screen. It is still attached and
  still enumerated, so a presence check misses the most common tablet posture.

Fold-back is reported as `SW_TABLET_MODE` on an `EV_SW` device. The predicate is
therefore *tablet mode **or** no usable keyboard*, not either alone.

## Nothing here matches on a device name

Where the switch lives differs by model, and the name is not a reliable handle:

| | Surface Go | Surface Pro 7+ |
|---|---|---|
| Device name | `Intel HID switches` | `Microsoft Surface Type Cover Tablet Mode Switch` |
| Provided by | the chassis | the Type Cover itself |
| On detach | switch persists | switch disappears with the cover |
| Name is unique? | yes | no: ten devices share it, one exposes `SW_TABLET_MODE` |

So on a Pro 7+ the two conditions collapse into one device's presence, while on
a Go they stay genuinely independent. A missing switch means "no cover", not
"not in tablet mode", which the predicate above already handles.

The switch is found by capability (`EV_SW` containing `SW_TABLET_MODE`), which
is correct on both.

Keyboard presence is also capability-based, with one wrinkle: an x86 machine
enumerates an `AT Translated Set 2 keyboard` on i8042 whether or not anything is
attached to it, so "has alphabetic keys" is always true. Presence therefore
requires alphabetic keys **on a hotpluggable bus** (USB or Bluetooth).

## Why a root system unit

It reads `/dev/input` directly, which is `root:input`, exactly as
`trackpad-injector` and `two-finger-rightclick` do. That avoids adding anyone to
the `input` group, needs no compositor dependency, and keeps per-model device
names out of the Hyprland config.

Attach and detach need no separate udev trigger: the devices appearing and
disappearing under `/dev/input` is the signal, watched with inotify.

The keyboard itself is started **as the session user** with `setpriv`, since it
must be the user's own Wayland client. The unit is deliberately not ordered
against the graphical session so it survives the compositor restarting; it
discovers the Wayland socket when it needs one and does nothing until one
exists.

## What it publishes

`/run/omarchy-tablet-mode`, rewritten atomically on every change:

```
TABLET_MODE=0
KEYBOARD_ATTACHED=1
KEYBOARD_USABLE=1
```

`KEYBOARD_USABLE` is the derived answer most consumers want, computed once so
every hook agrees.

## Hooks

Every executable in `/etc/omarchy-tablet-mode.d/` runs on each transition, with
those three values plus `TARGET_UID`, `TARGET_GID` and `USER_XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`
in the environment. A hook that fails is logged and does not stop the others.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# /etc/omarchy-tablet-mode.d/60-rotation-lock
[[ ${TABLET_MODE:-0} -eq 1 ]] && unlock-rotation || lock-rotation
```

Hooks run as **root**. Anything that has to be the user's own Wayland client
needs `setpriv`; `50-onscreen-keyboard` shows the pattern.

## Choosing the keyboard

```bash
sudo systemctl edit omarchy-tablet-mode.service
```

```ini
[Service]
Environment="OSK_COMMAND=squeekboard"
```

The default is the patched `wvkbd-deskintl` from [`../osk/`](../osk/), started
**without** `--hidden`. That matters: wvkbd implements `virtual-keyboard-v1`
only, so it sends keystrokes and has no way to hear that a text field took
focus. Started hidden it would need `SUPER+SHIFT+K` to reveal, which is a
keypress you cannot make on a machine whose keyboard just became unusable.

`squeekboard` is the opposite: it implements `text-input-v3`, starts hidden by
design and shows itself when a text field takes focus. Folding the cover while
looking at a window with no text field therefore shows nothing until you tap
one. Both behaviours are correct for their keyboard; neither pops up merely
because the cover moved.

> Quote the value. `Environment=` splits on whitespace, so an unquoted command
> with arguments is parsed as several assignments and the arguments are silently

**A note on what "running" means.** With `wvkbd --hidden` the keyboard is
launched but not shown; you still toggle it. With `squeekboard` it appears by
itself when a text field takes focus, so folding the cover while looking at a
window with no text field shows nothing until you tap one. Neither keyboard pops
up merely because the cover moved.

## Verify

```bash
systemctl status omarchy-tablet-mode.service
journalctl -u omarchy-tablet-mode.service -f
```

Then fold the cover, unfold it, and detach it. Expect one line per transition:

```
tablet=1 keyboard_attached=1 keyboard_usable=0     <- folded back
tablet=0 keyboard_attached=1 keyboard_usable=1     <- unfolded
tablet=0 keyboard_attached=0 keyboard_usable=0     <- detached
```

`cat /run/omarchy-tablet-mode` at any point shows the same values.

The third line is a detach on a Surface Go: the chassis switch still reads
`False` while the keyboard is gone, which is why the predicate checks both.

**Fold twice.** A single cycle passing is not enough to prove the process is
being reaped correctly: `pgrep` matches zombies, so a daemon that leaks one
reports the keyboard as permanently running and silently stops starting it.
