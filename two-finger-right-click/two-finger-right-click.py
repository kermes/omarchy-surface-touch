"""Two-finger-tap-to-right-click for the IPTS touchscreen.

Passively reads the touchscreen device (never grabs it -- all normal touch
events keep flowing to Hyprland untouched) and watches for exactly two
fingers touching down close together in time, staying nearly still, and
lifting quickly. On a clean tap, moves a synthetic absolute-positioning
virtual pointer (same pattern VNC/remote-desktop tools use) to the midpoint
of the two touch points and clicks BTN_RIGHT there -- Hyprland doesn't move
a persistent cursor position for real touch delivery, so a plain relative
click would land wherever a physical mouse/trackpad last parked it instead.
